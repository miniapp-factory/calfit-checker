An image of a stylized plate with a bold white checkmark overlay, representing meal scanning and workout verification. The plate is a simple white circle with a green checkmark in the center, set against a light blue background. The checkmark is thick and white, symbolizing confirmation. The overall design is clean, modern, and suitable for a fitness app logo.
