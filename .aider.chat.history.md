The files that will need to be edited to reflect the CalFit Checker App branding are:

- `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` constants.
- `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new logo description for the CalFit Checker App.

Please add the file `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` to the chat so I can create the logo description for the CalFit Checker App.
